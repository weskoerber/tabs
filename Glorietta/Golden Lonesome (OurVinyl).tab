[Intro]
A5 D A5 Aadd9
A5 D A5 Aadd9

[Chorus 1]
A5                     D        A5
God damn this cold and lonesome feeling
                       D         A5
I can't sleep, I don't feel like eating
                       D         A5
God damn this cold and lonesome feeling
        Amaj9           F#m
I don't know what to do with myself

[Verse 1]
D                           A5
Fuck me, I feel like I'm falling
                        F#m
And I got no place to land
D
It takes a real good woman
B7
To make a mess of a man

[Chrous 2]
A5                     D        A5
God damn this cold and lonesome feeling
                       D         A5
I can't sleep, I don't feel like eating
                       D         A5
God damn this cold and lonesome feeling
        Amaj9           F#m
I don't know what to do with myself

[Verse 1]
D
I never saw you comin'
                         F#m
You hit me square in the eye
Better to kill it quickly
B7
Than to slowly watch it die

[Chrous 3]
A5                     D        A5
God damn this cold and lonesome feeling
                       D         A5
I can't sleep, I don't feel like eating
                       D         A5
God damn this cold and lonesome feeling
        Amaj9           F#m
I don't know what to do with myself

[Outro]
A5      Amaj9           F#m
I don't know what to do with myself
             F#m 
Man, I don't know what to do with myself
